    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What are the types of databases?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relational Database (RDBMS)** – Uses tables and SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)\n",
    "* **NoSQL Database** – Non-tabular (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)\n",
    "* **Hierarchical Database** – Tree-like structure (e.g., IBM IMS)\n",
    "* **Network Database** – Many-to-many relationships (e.g., IDMS)\n",
    "* **Object-Oriented Database** – Stores objects (e.g., db4o)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is a relational database?**  \n",
    "A **relational database** stores data in tables (relations) consisting of rows and columns. Relationships between tables are maintained using primary and foreign keys. SQL is used to interact with the data.\n",

    "**4. What is SQL?**  \n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing relational databases. It is used to query, insert, update, and delete data and also define schema (DDL).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What is a primary key?**  \n",
    "A **primary key** is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must be unique and not null.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What is a record (row) and a field (column)?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Record (Row)**: A single data item or tuple.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "In a `users` table:\n",

    "**11. What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**: Used for real-time transactional systems (e.g., ATM systems). Fast, short transactions.\n",
    "* **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**: Used for data analysis and reporting. Handles complex queries and large volumes of historical data.\n",
