    "### ✅ General Project Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Can you explain the architecture of your Online Bookstore project?**\n",
    "I followed the Spring MVC architecture with a layered structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Controller Layer** for handling HTTP requests,\n",
    "* **Service Layer** for business logic,\n",
    "* **Repository Layer** for database access using JPA,\n",
    "* **Model Layer** for representing entities like Book, User, Category, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is the role of each layer in your Spring MVC architecture?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Controller** receives the request and returns the response.\n",
    "* **Service** contains business logic and calls repository methods.\n",
    "* **Repository** interfaces handle data persistence with JPA.\n",
    "* **Model** represents the domain objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. How did you design your database schema for the bookstore?**\n",
    "I used MySQL with entities like `Book`, `User`, `Category`, and `Order`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One-to-many and many-to-one relationships were defined using `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What are the key entities/tables in your project, and how are they related?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Book**: Related to Category (many-to-one).\n",
    "* **User**: Related to Orders (one-to-many).\n",
    "* **Order**: Contains books and linked to a User.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. How did you handle validations in your REST API?**\n",
    "I used annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, etc., in DTOs or entities, and handled validation errors using `@ControllerAdvice`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. How do you manage exceptions in your Spring Boot application?**\n",
    "I created custom exceptions and handled them globally using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What HTTP methods did you use for CRUD operations and why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GET` – for retrieving books or users\n",
    "* `POST` – to create new entities\n",
    "* `PUT` – to update resources\n",
    "* `DELETE` – to remove entities\n",
    "  These follow RESTful API design principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. How did you test your APIs using Postman or Swagger?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Postman, I tested endpoints by sending JSON payloads.\n",
    "* Swagger was integrated for auto-generated API documentation and also used for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Spring Boot & Java Specific\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. How did you implement dependency injection in your project?**\n",
    "Spring handles it using annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What are some annotations you frequently used in your Spring Boot code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Entity`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@Autowired`, `@PathVariable`, `@RequestBody`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. How did you use `@Entity`, `@Repository`, `@Service`, and `@Controller` in your application?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@Entity` defines database tables\n",
    "* `@Repository` handles DB operations\n",
    "* `@Service` contains business logic\n",
    "* `@Controller/@RestController` handles client requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Can you explain how you used JPA and Hibernate for ORM?**\n",
    "I mapped Java objects to MySQL tables using JPA annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, and used `JpaRepository` for DB access. Hibernate handled the actual persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. What is the difference between `JpaRepository` and `CrudRepository`? Which one did you use?**\n",
    "`JpaRepository` extends `CrudRepository` and provides extra methods like pagination and sorting. I used `JpaRepository`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. How did you implement pagination or sorting for listing books?**\n",
    "I used `Pageable` and `Sort` interfaces from Spring Data JPA with `findAll(Pageable pageable)` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**15. How did you manage application properties and configurations?**\n",
    "I used `application.properties` or `application.yml` to configure DB connections, Swagger, and server settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Advanced / Functional Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**16. How did you implement the book search and category filtering features?**\n",
    "I wrote custom JPA query methods like `findByTitleContaining()` and `findByCategoryName()` in the `BookRepository`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**17. How is user account management handled? Did you implement login/register/authentication?**\n",
    "Yes, in the Bookstore system, I implemented user registration with validation. For authentication, I planned to use Spring Security, but initial versions used manual verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**18. How did you ensure data integrity in user input (e.g., duplicate books or invalid users)?**\n",
    "I validated inputs using annotations and handled duplicates using constraints in the database and by checking existing records before inserting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**19. What is the most challenging part of the project, and how did you overcome it?**\n",
    "Designing complex relationships and handling exceptions uniformly was challenging. I used DTOs and global exception handlers to simplify this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**20. How did you test error scenarios (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request)?**\n",
    "Using Postman, I tested by sending wrong URLs, missing fields, and invalid formats, and ensured that proper error responses were returned via custom exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Swagger, Postman & API Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**21. How did Swagger help in documenting your API?**\n",
    "Swagger automatically generated UI documentation for all my APIs, showing request methods, parameters, and example responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**22. What is the difference between Swagger and Postman in your workflow?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Swagger** is built-in and provides real-time documentation and testing.\n",
    "* **Postman** is an external tool I used for detailed and manual API testing with collections and environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**23. Can you show or explain a sample API endpoint from your project?**\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@GetMapping(\"/books/{id}\")\n",
    "public ResponseEntity<Book> getBookById(@PathVariable Long id) {\n",
    "    return ResponseEntity.ok(bookService.getBookById(id));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**24. How did you version your APIs (if at all)?**\n",
    "I considered versioning using `/api/v1/` in the request mapping, but versioning was not implemented fully in this phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ ID Card Generator Project Specific\n",
    "\n",
    "**25. How did you dynamically generate ID cards from user input?**\n",
    "The backend generated user credentials and stored them in MySQL. Though I didn’t generate images, the system was designed to dynamically create data entries representing ID records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**26. Did you use any external libraries or templates for the ID generation?**\n",
    "Not yet, but I planned to use PDF/image libraries like iText or Apache POI in the next phase for generating downloadable cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**27. How did you handle user data securely in the database?**\n",
    "I validated input and used unique constraints. Planned features include password encryption and role-based access using Spring Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**28. What happens if duplicate user entries are submitted?**\n",
    "The system checks for existing users via email or ID. If found, it returns a 400 error with a custom message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**29. Did you implement file upload/download or image generation for the ID card?**\n",
    "No, in the current version, only data was created and stored. In future versions, I plan to add file handling and card image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ GitHub, Deployment & Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**30. How did you use GitHub for source control in these projects?**\n",
    "I used GitHub for version control, pushed code regularly, and maintained a clean commit history with meaningful messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**31. What are some best practices you followed while coding these projects?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Followed clean code principles\n",
    "* Used DTOs to separate entity from input/output\n",
    "* Handled exceptions globally\n",
    "* Wrote modular, testable code\n",
    "* Used meaningful variable and method names\n",
    "\n",
    "**32. Have you deployed any of these projects? If so, where and how?**\n",
    "Not yet deployed, but I tested locally on Tomcat (embedded in Spring Boot). I’m planning to deploy it on Render or Railway using a GitHub pipeline.\n",
