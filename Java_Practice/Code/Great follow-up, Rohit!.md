Great follow-up, Rohit!

Here’s a breakdown of **user-specific** and **admin-specific features** you can implement in your **Spring Boot + Thymeleaf/REST** project for the `users` table:

---

## 👤 **Features for Normal Users**

These are features accessible after a normal user logs in.

### 1. **View Available Books**

* Browse all books
* Filter by category, title, author, price

### 2. **Search Books**

* Input search query (title, author, etc.)
* Dynamic results or refresh page

### 3. **View Book Details**

* Full description
* Stock availability
* Category, price

### 4. **Register/Login/Logout**

* Secure login
* Register new user
* Logout button/session management

### 5. **Edit Profile**

* Change name, email, password

### 6. **Review/Ratings** (optional feature)

* Rate or review books
* View average rating on book page

---

## 🛠️ **Features for Admin Users**

Admin has control over the system data (users, books, categories). You can implement **role-based access control** to show/hide admin panels.

### 📚 **Books Management**

* View/Add/Edit/Delete books
* Assign categories
* Update stock

### 📂 **Category Management**

* View/Add/Edit/Delete categories

### 👤 **User Management**

* View all registered users
* Assign roles (User/Admin)
* Delete user accounts

### 📊 **Admin Dashboard**

* See stats: total books, users, categories
* Chart/graph visualizations (optional)

### 🔐 **Role-based Access Control**

* Show admin panel only for admin users
* Hide admin actions (add/delete buttons) for normal users

## 🧠 Optional Admin Features (for learning and bonus points):

* Activity log (who added/updated/deleted)
* Book sales statistics (if you add order system)
* Export users or books to CSV/PDF

If you want, I can help you:

* Set up **Spring Security** with roles (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`)
* Design the **HTML page layout** for user/admin
* Add **role-based access in controller methods**

Let me know which one you'd like to work on next!
