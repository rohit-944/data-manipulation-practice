    "## ✅ 1. **Variables, Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. What is a variable in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** A variable is a container used to store data during program execution. It must be declared with a data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What are primitive data types in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Primitive types include `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`. They store actual values and are not objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What are non-primitive data types in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Non-primitive types are objects like `String`, arrays, and user-defined classes. They store references to memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is the default value of primitive types?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",

    "## ✅ 2. **Wrapper Classes, Auto-boxing, Unboxing**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. What is a wrapper class in Java?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q2. List all wrapper classes in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Character`, `Boolean`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is auto-boxing in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Auto-boxing is automatic conversion of a primitive type to its wrapper class object.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int a = 10;\n",
    "Integer obj = a;  // auto-boxing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is unboxing in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Unboxing is the automatic conversion of a wrapper class object to its primitive type.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer obj = 20;\n",
    "int a = obj;  // unboxing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What happens if you unbox a null wrapper object?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It throws a `NullPointerException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer obj = null;\n",
    "int x = obj; // throws NullPointerException\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Does auto-boxing/unboxing impact performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, it can introduce performance overhead due to object creation and method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Can you use `==` to compare wrapper objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** No, use `.equals()` instead of `==` because `==` compares object references.\n",

    "**Answer:** Type casting is the process of converting a value of one data type to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What are the types of type casting in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Widening (Implicit):** Smaller to larger (e.g., `int` to `long`)\n",
    "* **Narrowing (Explicit):** Larger to smaller (e.g., `double` to `int` using `(int)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Example of type casting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",

    "**Answer:** `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. What is the role of each keyword?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **try:** Code that may throw an exception\n",
    "* **catch:** Handles the exception\n",
    "* **finally:** Executes regardless of exception\n",
    "* **throw:** Manually throw an exception\n",
    "* **throws:** Declare exceptions that may be thrown\n",

    "## ✅ **4. Try-Catch Block**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. What is a try-catch block in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "It’s used to catch and handle exceptions.\n",

    "### Q9. Can we have multiple catch blocks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Yes. Each can catch a different exception type.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "It runs **after try/catch** — even if an exception is thrown or caught. Often used to release resources.\n",

    "## ✅ **5. Method Call Stack and Exception Propagation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q11. What is exception propagation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "If an exception is not caught in a method, it is **passed to the caller** method, up the call stack until caught or program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "void a() { b(); }\n",
    "void b() { c(); }\n",
    "void c() { int x = 10/0; } // Exception propagates up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q12. How does the call stack affect exception handling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "When an exception occurs, the method where it occurred is pushed onto the call stack and then removed as the exception propagates.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q14. What is the use of `throws` keyword?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Used in method signature to **declare** that it may throw an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "void readFile() throws IOException {\n",
    "    // code\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q15. Can we use both `throw` and `throws` together?\n",

    "try { ... }\n",
    "catch (IOException e) { ... }\n",
    "catch (SQLException e) { ... }\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q17. Which exception should be caught first?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Catch subclasses first, then superclasses. Otherwise, the compiler will throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **8. User-Defined Exception**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q18. Can we create custom exceptions in Java?\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q21. Will `finally` block execute if System.exit() is called?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "No. `finally` does **not execute** if the JVM exits using `System.exit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q22. What if exception occurs inside `finally` block?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "It will override any previous exceptions unless handled inside `finally` itself.\n",
