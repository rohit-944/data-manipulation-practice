    "Great, Rohit! Here's a **complete set of clear, interview-ready answers** for your SQL and MySQL questions. Focus on understanding the *concepts* — most interviewers will ask follow-ups.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Basic SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is SQL?**\n",
    "   SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to store, retrieve, manage, and manipulate data in relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the different types of SQL commands?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **DDL (Data Definition Language):** `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`\n",
    "   * **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`\n",
    "   * **DCL (Data Control Language):** `GRANT`, `REVOKE`\n",
    "   * **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`\n",
    "   * **DQL (Data Query Language):** `SELECT`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   | Command    | Description               | Can Rollback | Removes Table? |\n",
    "   | ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |\n",
    "   | `DELETE`   | Deletes rows (with WHERE) | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No           |\n",
    "   | `TRUNCATE` | Deletes all rows (faster) | ❌ No         | ❌ No           |\n",
    "   | `DROP`     | Deletes table structure   | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes          |\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is a primary key and foreign key?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each row. Not null and unique.\n",
    "   * **Foreign Key:** A field in one table that refers to the **primary key** in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What are constraints in SQL?**\n",
    "   Constraints are rules applied to columns to enforce data integrity. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `WHERE`: Filters rows **before** grouping. Used with `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, etc.\n",
    "   * `HAVING`: Filters groups **after** `GROUP BY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is the use of GROUP BY and ORDER BY?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `GROUP BY`: Groups rows with the same values (used with aggregate functions).\n",
    "   * `ORDER BY`: Sorts the result set (ascending by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What are joins? Name different types of joins.**\n",
    "   Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.\n",
    "   Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `INNER JOIN` – Matching records only\n",
    "   * `LEFT JOIN` – All from left + matching from right\n",
    "   * `RIGHT JOIN` – All from right + matching from left\n",
    "   * `FULL JOIN` – All records with matches or NULLs\n",
    "   * `SELF JOIN` – Table joined with itself\n",
    "   * `CROSS JOIN` – Cartesian product\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is a subquery?**\n",
    "   A query inside another query.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is normalization? What are its types?**\n",
    "    Normalization reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.\n",
    "    Common types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * 1NF – Atomic values\n",
    "    * 2NF – No partial dependency\n",
    "    * 3NF – No transitive dependency\n",
    "    * BCNF – Advanced 3NF\n",

    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are AUTO\\_INCREMENT and DEFAULT in MySQL?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `AUTO_INCREMENT`: Automatically generates a unique value (often for primary key).\n",
    "   * `DEFAULT`: Sets a default value for a column if no value is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR in MySQL?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `CHAR(n)`: Fixed-length. Pads with spaces.\n",
