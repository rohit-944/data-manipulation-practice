    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. What is SQL?**\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with relational databases. It allows users to **create, read, update, and delete** data and manage database structure and permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. What is a database?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data stored electronically. Data is typically structured in **tables** with **rows and columns** and managed by a DBMS (Database Management System).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. What are the main types of SQL commands?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DDL** (Data Definition Language): `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`\n",
    "* **DML** (Data Manipulation Language): `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`\n",
    "* **DCL** (Data Control Language): `GRANT`, `REVOKE`\n",
    "* **TCL** (Transaction Control Language): `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR2?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CHAR**: Fixed-length, padded with spaces if data is shorter.\n",
    "* **VARCHAR2**: Variable-length, stores only actual characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. What is a primary key?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **primary key** uniquely identifies each row in a table. It does **not allow NULLs or duplicate values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. What is a foreign key?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **foreign key** creates a relationship between two tables by referring to the **primary key** in another table. It ensures referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. What is the purpose of the DEFAULT constraint?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It assigns a **default value** to a column when no value is provided during `INSERT`.\n",
