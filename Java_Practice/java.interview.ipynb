    "## ✅ 1. **Variables, Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. What is a variable in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** A variable is a container used to store data during program execution. It must be declared with a data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What are primitive data types in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Primitive types include `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`. They store actual values and are not objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What are non-primitive data types in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Non-primitive types are objects like `String`, arrays, and user-defined classes. They store references to memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is the default value of primitive types?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q6. What are literals in Java?\n",
    "\n",

    "## ✅ 2. **Wrapper Classes, Auto-boxing, Unboxing**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. What is a wrapper class in Java?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q2. List all wrapper classes in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Character`, `Boolean`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is auto-boxing in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Auto-boxing is automatic conversion of a primitive type to its wrapper class object.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int a = 10;\n",
    "Integer obj = a;  // auto-boxing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is unboxing in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Unboxing is the automatic conversion of a wrapper class object to its primitive type.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer obj = 20;\n",
    "int a = obj;  // unboxing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What happens if you unbox a null wrapper object?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It throws a `NullPointerException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer obj = null;\n",
    "int x = obj; // throws NullPointerException\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Does auto-boxing/unboxing impact performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, it can introduce performance overhead due to object creation and method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Can you use `==` to compare wrapper objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** No, use `.equals()` instead of `==` because `==` compares object references.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "* **Non-Primitive:** String, Array, Class, Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is type casting?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Type casting is the process of converting a value of one data type to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What are the types of type casting in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Widening (Implicit):** Smaller to larger (e.g., `int` to `long`)\n",
    "* **Narrowing (Explicit):** Larger to smaller (e.g., `double` to `int` using `(int)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Example of type casting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "double d = 10.5;\n",
    "int x = (int) d;  // narrowing conversion\n",
